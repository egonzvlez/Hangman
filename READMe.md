# Hangman

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game implemented in python. In this game a random word is generated
and the user will try guessing by suggesting letter one at a time. With each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure 
is drawn, representing a hanging man. The goal is to guess the word before the stick figure is completed.
